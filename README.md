# Roundhouse
## Round off all Object Dimensions in InDesign

Modified [Derrick's original Roundhouse script](https://github.com/dvschultz/roundhouse):
+ only rounds selected objects
+ skips over locked objects (you shouldn't be able to select locked objects anyway)
+ before rounding, it runs Fits Frame to Content on the selected object. so you can set the Cmd+Option+C shortcut to run this script instead.
