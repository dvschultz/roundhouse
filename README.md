# Roundhouse
## Round off all Object Dimensions in InDesign

I made this for [Allen Tan](http://tanmade.com), so it currently only matches the following workflow:
* currently forces layout to pixels
* rounds upper left corner, but always rounds up on bottom right (this is likely to cause some issues, will be fixed eventually)
